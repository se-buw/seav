### ðŸ“Œ 1. **Topic Health & Overview**
Use this to get a **quick summary** of your bag contents.

```bash
ros2 bag info /path/to/your_bag
```

Check for:
- Expected topics (`/scan`, `/odom`, `/tf`, `/imu/data`, `/distance`)
- Message types
- Duration
- Frequency (helpful for debugging dropped/missing data)

---

### ðŸ“Œ 2. **TF Tree Visualization**
Check if all required transforms are being published.

```bash
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames
```

- Opens `frames.pdf` to visualize the full transform tree.
- Must contain: `odom â†’ base_link â†’ sensors (lidar, imu)`
- Missing or broken TFs? â†’ SLAM & Navigation will break.

---

### ðŸ“Œ 3. **Sensor Quality Checks**
Run these in Jupyter or script to inspect sensor behavior:

#### ðŸ”¹ `/scan` (Lidar):
- Plot distance ranges (`range` values over time)
- Look for all-zero scans (indicates sensor isn't working)
- Check 360Â° coverage

#### ðŸ”¹ `/imu/data`:
- Plot `angular_velocity.z`, `linear_acceleration.x/y/z`
- Should show variation when moving/rotating

#### ðŸ”¹ `/distance` (custom topic):
- Plot over time
- Compare to expected physical movement

---

### ðŸ“Œ 4. **Data Synchronization Test**
Check if `/odom`, `/imu/data`, `/scan` have **aligned timestamps**.

- Write a script to compute `timestamp` deltas between topics
- SLAM accuracy depends on this alignment!

---

### ðŸ“Œ 5. **Path Reconstruction**
Rebuild the robot path from:
- `/odom` (raw odometry)
- `/amcl_pose` (localized pose)
- `/slam_toolbox/pose` (map frame pose)

Plot all together to compare drift vs correction.

---

### ðŸ“Œ 6. **Velocity and Motion Pattern**
Use twist values to:
- Detect start/stop events
- Measure average speed
- Spot anomalies (e.g., spiking angular velocity, zero linear velocity)

---

### ðŸ“Œ 7. **Ground Truth Comparison (if available)**
If you recorded `/ground_truth` or `gazebo/model_states`, compare them to `/odom`.

- Helps measure drift, error, and reliability of your fusion logic.

---

### ðŸ“Œ 8. **Replay & Visualization**
You can **play back** your bag file and visualize live in RViz:

```bash
ros2 bag play /path/to/your_bag --clock
```

- Enable `/odom`, `/scan`, `/tf`, `/map`, etc. in RViz
- Helps see if data looks correct visually (e.g., stuck robot, scan moving with base, etc.)

---

### ðŸ“Œ 9. **Re-simulation for Nav2**
If you recorded everything including `/cmd_vel`, `/scan`, `/map`, `/odom`, you can simulate navigation without the real robot!

- Launch your Nav2 stack
- Play the bag and see if planner/controller behave properly

---

### ðŸ“Œ 10. **Export Data to CSV for ML or Analytics**
Use your bag as a data source for training models:

```bash
# Or use python scripts to save:
df.to_csv("odom_data.csv")
```

You can later use this for:
- Drift estimation
- Learning-based motion models
- Visual-inertial SLAM tuning
