To create an accurate URDF file for your small car, I'll need a few additional details. Here are some specific questions:

1. **Dimensions**:
   - What are the overall dimensions of the car (length, width, height)?
   - What are the wheel diameters and widths?
   - What is the distance between the front and rear wheel axles (wheelbase)?
   - What is the distance between the left and right wheels (track width)?

2. **Mounting Positions**:
   - Where is the **Raspberry Pi** mounted (x, y, z position relative to the car’s base)?
   - Where is the **RPLIDAR A1** mounted (x, y, z position and orientation)?

3. **Servo and Motor Details**:
   - For the **servo motor** controlling the front wheels, is it positioned at the center of the front axle, or is it offset?
   - For the **DC motors** on the rear wheels, are they mounted on each wheel’s axis, or is there a differential?

4. **Base Link Position**:
   - Where would you like the **base link** to be positioned on the car? Usually, this is at the car's geometric center or at the center of the rear axle.
