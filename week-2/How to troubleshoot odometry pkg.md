Here's some troubleshooting code and tips to help you identify and fix issues with the odometry package. We'll create a simple test script to verify that the node is publishing correctly and that the data being published on the `/odom` topic matches expected values.

### 1. **Basic ROS2 Topic Debugging Commands**

   Before writing any code, try these commands to quickly check if the topic is active and the messages are being published correctly.

   - **List active topics**:
     ```bash
     ros2 topic list
     ```
     Ensure that `/odom` appears in the list. If not, the node might not be running or publishing.

   - **Check the message type**:
     ```bash
     ros2 topic info /odom
     ```
     This will display the message type (`nav_msgs/msg/Odometry`) and other details. It should match the expected type.

   - **Echo topic data**:
     ```bash
     ros2 topic echo /odom
     ```
     This command will display the data being published on the `/odom` topic. Verify that values update as expected, especially `position`, `orientation`, and `linear`/`angular` velocities.

### 2. **Create a Test Script to Subscribe and Log Data**

   To verify if the data is published correctly, you can create a test subscriber script in Python that subscribes to `/odom` and logs the received values. 

   1. In the `odometry_package` directory, create a file named `test_odometry_subscriber.py`:

      ```bash
      cd ~/ros2_ws/src/odometry_package/odometry_package
      touch test_odometry_subscriber.py
      ```

   2. Add the following code to `test_odometry_subscriber.py`:

      ```python
      # test_odometry_subscriber.py
      import rclpy
      from rclpy.node import Node
      from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry

      class TestOdometrySubscriber(Node):
          def __init__(self):
              super().__init__('test_odometry_subscriber')
              self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
                  Odometry,
                  '/odom',
                  self.odom_callback,
                  10
              )
              self.get_logger().info("Test Odometry Subscriber has been started.")

          def odom_callback(self, msg):
              # Log the received odometry data for troubleshooting
              position = msg.pose.pose.position
              orientation = msg.pose.pose.orientation
              linear_velocity = msg.twist.twist.linear
              angular_velocity = msg.twist.twist.angular

              self.get_logger().info(f"Position -> x: {position.x}, y: {position.y}")
              self.get_logger().info(f"Orientation -> x: {orientation.x}, y: {orientation.y}, z: {orientation.z}, w: {orientation.w}")
              self.get_logger().info(f"Linear Velocity -> x: {linear_velocity.x}, y: {linear_velocity.y}, z: {linear_velocity.z}")
              self.get_logger().info(f"Angular Velocity -> x: {angular_velocity.x}, y: {angular_velocity.y}, z: {angular_velocity.z}")

      def main(args=None):
          rclpy.init(args=args)
          node = TestOdometrySubscriber()
          try:
              rclpy.spin(node)
          except KeyboardInterrupt:
              pass
          finally:
              node.destroy_node()
              rclpy.shutdown()

      if __name__ == '__main__':
          main()
      ```

   3. **Explanation of the Code**:
      - This node subscribes to the `/odom` topic and logs the received position, orientation, and velocities.
      - You can check if the values match your expectations (e.g., the linear velocity should match the set value, and position/orientation should change over time if the robot is moving).

### 3. **Add the Test Node to `setup.py`**

   - Open `setup.py` and add `test_odometry_subscriber` to the entry points:

     ```python
     entry_points={
         'console_scripts': [
             'odometry_node = odometry_package.odometry_node:main',
             'test_odometry_subscriber = odometry_package.test_odometry_subscriber:main',
         ],
     }
     ```

### 4. **Rebuild the Package**

   - Rebuild the package to apply changes:
     ```bash
     cd ~/ros2_ws
     colcon build
     source install/setup.bash
     ```

### 5. **Run the Test Node**

   - Run the test subscriber node:
     ```bash
     ros2 run odometry_package test_odometry_subscriber
     ```
   - Check the terminal output to verify that values for position, orientation, and velocities are reasonable and align with expected changes over time.

### 6. **Troubleshooting Tips**

   - **No Data on `/odom` Topic**:
     - Ensure the `odometry_node` is running by checking the output from:
       ```bash
       ros2 run odometry_package odometry_node
       ```
     - Check for error messages or warnings.
   
   - **Static or Incorrect Data**:
     - If data isnâ€™t updating as expected, verify the update rate (`self.timer` interval) and calculation of position/velocity in `odometry_node.py`.
     - Use print statements or logger information at key points to track variable values (e.g., `self.x`, `self.y`, `self.theta`).

   - **Verify Frame IDs**:
     - Make sure the `header.frame_id` in the `Odometry` message matches the expected frame in your system (e.g., `odom` and `base_link`). Mismatched frame IDs can cause issues in downstream processing.

   - **Orientation Issues**:
     - If orientation data seems off, verify that the quaternion values are correct. Check that `quaternion_from_euler` is correctly converting from Euler angles, and ensure the orientation axis (`theta`) is in radians.

This approach will help identify and resolve issues, ensuring your odometry node works as expected. Let me know if you encounter any specific issues while troubleshooting!
